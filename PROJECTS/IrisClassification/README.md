# 🌼 Iris Classification Project 🌼

Welcome to my Iris Classification project! 🚀 This project marks the beginning of my journey into the world of Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science. It showcases how I started exploring ML concepts, model building, and evaluation techniques using Python.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into one of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their petal and sepal measurements. I used the classic Iris dataset to train a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, one of the most intuitive and beginner-friendly machine learning algorithms.

Note: This project was created with the guidance of ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI. It's a stepping stone for me to dive deeper into more complex ML projects in the future.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Data Loading & Exploration**: Loading the Iris dataset and exploring it with Pandas and Seaborn visualizations.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling data preparation and splitting it into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- **Visualizations**: Plotting graphs to better understand the data distribution and model performance.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and model experimentation.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Handling numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning model building and evaluation.

Here's a snapshot of the model's performance:

**Accuracy**: 100%

**Confusion Matrix**:
```
[[19  0  0]
 [ 0 13  0]
 [ 0  0 13]]
```

**Classification Report**:
```
             precision    recall  f1-score   support
         0       1.00      1.00      1.00        19
         1       1.00      1.00      1.00        13
         2       1.00      1.00      1.00        13
```

## 📈 Visualizing the Results

To visualize the model's performance, I included several plots, such as:

- Pair plots for feature relationships.
- Heatmaps for the confusion matrix.

## 🎯 Future Goals

This project is just the beginning of my journey into machine learning. Here are some ideas I plan to explore next:

- Experimenting with other classification algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM).
- Applying more complex data preprocessing techniques.
- Exploring other datasets and solving different ML problems (e.g., regression, clustering).
- Creating a web app to showcase the model using Streamlit.
